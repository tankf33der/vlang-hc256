Vlang implementation of hc256 RNG.

PracRand says:
```
HC-256 is the highest quality recommended RNG and the most cryptographically secure. Its biggest drawback is slow seeding time.  It's also a little slow and a bit large, but not so much of either of those as to hinder usability for typical purposes.
